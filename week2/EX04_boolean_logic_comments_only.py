# EX04 - Boolean logic (COMMENTS ONLY)
#
# Goal:
#   Make a “pool rules” checker.
#
# Ask:
#   - Age (int)
#   - Can you swim? (yes/no)
#
# Rules:
#   - If age >= 10 AND can_swim is yes -> "You can go in the deep end."
#   - Otherwise -> "Stay in the shallow end."
#
# Hint:
#   can_swim = input("Can you swim? ").strip().lower()
#   if age >= 10 and can_swim == "yes":
#       ...
