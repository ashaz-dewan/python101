# EX01 - Count and Sum (COMMENTS ONLY)
#
# Goal:
#   Ask the user for an integer n
#   Then:
#     - Print numbers from 1 to n
#     - Also print the sum of 1 to n at the end
#
# Example:
#   n = 5
#   Output:
#     1
#     2
#     3
#     4
#     5
#     Sum = 15
#
# Rules:
#   - Use a for loop with range()
#   - Use a running total variable
