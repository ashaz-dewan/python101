# EX02 - Multiplication Table (COMMENTS ONLY)
#
# Goal:
#   Ask the user for a number (int) called base
#   Print the multiplication table from 1 to 12:
#     base x 1 = ...
#     base x 2 = ...
#     ...
#     base x 12 = ...
#
# Example:
#   base = 7
#   7 x 1 = 7
#   7 x 2 = 14
#   ...
#
# Rules:
#   - Use a for loop
#   - Use range(1, 13)
